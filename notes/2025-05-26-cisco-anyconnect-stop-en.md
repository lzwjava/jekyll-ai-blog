Got it 👍 — you’re asking how to stop/kill **Cisco AnyConnect processes** like *NAM* (Network Access Manager) or the background service *vpnagent.exe* that runs when AnyConnect is installed.

Here’s a breakdown:

---

## 1. Understanding the processes
- **vpnagent.exe** → The “Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Agent” background service. It runs at startup and manages VPN connections and related modules (including NAM if installed).
- **NAM service** → Installed as **Cisco Network Access Manager**; it replaces Windows’ built-in network manager and automatically runs at system startup if enabled.

---

## 2. Stopping / killing AnyConnect processes (Windows)
### Option A: Stop service properly
1. Press **Win+R**, type `services.msc`, hit Enter.
2. Look for:
   - *Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Agent*
   - *Cisco Network Access Manager* (if installed)
3. Right-click → **Stop**.
4. To prevent auto-start: right-click → Properties → Set **Startup type** to *Disabled* (or *Manual*).

### Option B: Task Manager kill
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Esc** to open Task Manager.
2. Find `vpnagent.exe` or any Cisco AnyConnect process.
3. Right-click → **End task**.
   *(This only lasts until reboot or if the service relaunches automatically.)*

---

## 3. Uninstalling modules you don’t want
If you only want VPN and not NAM:
1. Go to **Control Panel → Programs and Features**.
2. Find **Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client**.
3. Click **Change** → Modify installation.
4. Uncheck **Network Access Manager** (keep VPN enabled if you still need it).
5. Finish — this surgically removes NAM but leaves the VPN working.

---

## ⚠️ Notes / Cautions
- Killing `vpnagent.exe` directly will also kill AnyConnect VPN functionality until you restart it.
- If NAM is managing Wi-Fi/ethernet, killing it without reverting to the Windows network manager may drop your network connection.
- Best practice is to disable/uninstall NAM if you don’t need it, rather than just force-killing.

👉 Do you want me to also show you the **command-line / PowerShell method** to stop and disable `vpnagent` and NAM services (so you don’t have to dive into services.msc every time)?
