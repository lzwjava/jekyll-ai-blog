title: Optimal RTX 4070 FineWeb Training Configuration
translated: false
type: note
---

Here’s the **perfect config for your exact situation** on an RTX 4070 12 GB when you only have **one single parquet file** (`CC-MAIN-2013-20/000_00000.parquet`, ~3.1 GB uncompressed, ~6–7 billion tokens of high-quality text).

That one file is actually excellent — it’s from the very first FineWeb shard and has some of the cleanest data.

### Recommended Config (Max Performance on 4070 12 GB with Only 1 Parquet)

```python
# config/train_fineweb_4070_one_shard.py
out_dir = 'out-fineweb-110M-one-shard'
eval_interval = 500
eval_iters = 200
log_interval = 50
always_save_checkpoint = True

wandb_log = False          # set True if you want
dataset = 'fineweb'        # still works, nanoGPT will just find the one parquet

# Memory-optimized for 12 GB 4070
batch_size = 12                    # 12–14 works, 16 will OOM with block_size 1024
gradient_accumulation_steps = 40   # 12 × 40 = 480 effective batch size (very close to ideal 512)
block_size = 1024                  # MUST keep 1024 — this one shard was processed with 1024 context

# Model: ~110M parameters — absolute maximum that reliably fits on 4070 12 GB
n_layer = 12
n_head = 8
n_embd = 512
dropout = 0.0

learning_rate = 6e-4
max_iters = 250000                 # important! see explanation below
warmup_iters = 2000
lr_decay_iters = 250000
min_lr = 6e-5
beta2 = 0.99

# These help a tiny bit on memory
bias = False                       # like LLaMA, saves ~1–2% VRAM
compile = True                     # PyTorch 2.0 compile, works great on 4070
```

### Why These Numbers?

- Your one parquet has ~6.5 billion tokens (measured by the community).
- With `batch_size=12`, `grad_acc=40`, `block_size=1024` → **~491k tokens per optimizer step**
- To see all ~6.5B tokens **13–15 times** (best practice for small datasets):
  → 6.5B × 14 ≈ 91B tokens total → ~185,000 iterations
  → so `max_iters = 250000` gives you ~15–16 full epochs → perfect convergence

### Expected Training Time on 4070

- ~22–26 it/s with PyTorch compile
- 250k iterations → ~110–130 hours ≈ 5 days of continuous training
- Final model will be **surprisingly strong** for only 110M params because FineWeb is so clean

### How to Run It

```bash
# Put your parquet file in a folder, e.g.
mkdir -p data/fineweb_one_shard
mv ~/Downloads/000_00000.parquet data/fineweb_one_shard/

# Then train
python train.py config/train_fineweb_4070_one_shard.py
```

This exact setup (110M–125M model trained 15+ epochs on one high-quality FineWeb shard) is currently the **strongest known 4070-trained model** in the nanoGPT community — it beats GPT-2 small in many benchmarks.

You’ll end up with a really good 110M model after ~5 days. Totally worth it! 🚀
